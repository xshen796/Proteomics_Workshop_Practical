## Optional readings:

Welcome! Before we start, it may be helpful if take time to read through these articles to help you better understand what we might go through in the tutorial.

-   Session I:

    -   Sun BB, Suhre K, Gibson BW. Promises and Challenges of populational Proteomics in Health and Disease. Mol Cell Proteomics. 2024 Jul;23(7):100786. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2024.100786
    
    Broader perspective: This paper explains how new proteomic technologies allow researchers to measure thousands of proteins in large populations, helping to find biomarkers and improve disease prediction. It highlights both the opportunities and challenges of using proteomics in large-scale studies.
    
    -   Schuermans, A., Pournamdari, A.B., Lee, J. et al. Integrative proteomic analyses across common cardiac diseases yield mechanistic insights and enhanced prediction. Nat Cardiovasc Res 3, 1516â€“1530 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-024-00567-0
    
    Example of method integration (cardiac diseases): This study integrates large-scale proteomics with epidemiological analyses, Mendelian randomization, and prediction modelling to identify proteins linked to major cardiac diseases and highlight potential therapeutic targets using UK Biobank data. 
    

-   Session II:

    -  Bhattacharyya U, John J, Lam M, Fisher J, Sun B, Baird D, Burgess S, Chen CY, Lencz T. Circulating Blood-Based Proteins in Psychopathology and Cognition: A Mendelian Randomization Study. JAMA Psychiatry. 2025 May 1;82(5):481-491. https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0033.

    Example that we will follow in our tutorial. We will focus on protein encoded by FOLH1 and bipolar disorder.
