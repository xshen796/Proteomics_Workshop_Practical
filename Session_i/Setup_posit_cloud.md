-   Within the practical session you can see in the Files pane (on the
    bottom right-hand side) all the files required for the practical.
    You can now run/edit these files as you wish.

    – Open either the .Rmd (recommended) or .R file depending upon your
    preference.

    – Choose “Visual” display setting in the .Rmd files to show
    formatted text.

    – Note if you do not have R packages installed required in this
    session, you will need to uncomment the install.packages() function
    calls.

    – After editing the files, your changes will be automatically saved
    in the permanent copy of the practical under “Your Workspace” in
    your personal RStudio Cloud account
