Welcome! This tutorial guides through the main steps to set up your local environment for the MQ-DATAMIND ECR workshop, 'Proteomics and Mental health'.

## Introduction

All scripts are written in R. You can choose to run the practical on a jupyter notebook provided to you and run the analysis on Google Cloud, or you could download scripts to your local computer or cluster and perform analysis on your own device. This Setup tutorial shows you steps to set up or local environment.

## Download R and RStudio

R and RStudio are available at the URL: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

In this page, scroll down and you will find two links for R and RStudio respectively. Download and install the latest versions of both following the prompts.

## Install R packages

Open RStudio, run the following commands in the console:

```{r}
source('utils/misc.R')

check_and_install_package("dplyr")
check_and_install_package("data.table")
check_and_install_package("readr")
check_and_install_package("here")
check_and_install_package("remotes")
check_and_install_package("TwoSampleMR")
```

The code should be able to check if you have installed the packages correctly. Contact Xueyi Shen (xueyi.shen@ed.ac.uk) if you run into any issue.
